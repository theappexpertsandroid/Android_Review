Review Android coding skills

Instructions:

Imagine you are working on the attached application as part of a team. This is just the first part of an application that will have a large number of features, multiple versions and that will be published for international markets.

Code review the application and make comments on the flaws, errors and possible improvements you would make to the code. You are expected to provide a pdf document with your review notes

Be as thorough as you can and tell us why and how you would do it. There are multiple ways to do things and while we might not agree with your suggestions we are looking for someone who is able to apply best practices, spot technical errors and areas of opportunity and suggest new or different ways to do things.

Feel free to suggest any 3rd party libraries or tools.
